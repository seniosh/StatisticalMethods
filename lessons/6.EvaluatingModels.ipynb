    "* Design and carry out a posterior predictive model check, and describe its relationship to a classical significance test\n",
    "\n",
    "* Recognize the Bayesian Evidence, know how it is computed, and describe the difference between a Bayes Factor and a likelihood ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "* Assign priors in various different ways\n",
    "\n",
    "* Be able to carry out cross-validation to check the prediction accuracy of a model   \n",
